# FCSplankton
A R package for analyzing phytoplankton population from discrete flow cytometry data. The script allows you to do gate population of interest, save gating parameters, and perform aggregate statistics. The FCSplankton repo includes also a data curation pipeline formatted to produce an excel spreadsheet that meets the standards for data submission into Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project (CMAP), an open source data portal of oceanographic datasets.
